Insertion Sort Algorithm
This is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in pseudo-code-like format. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
The provided code snippet demonstrates the insertion sort algorithm using an example array named cards. The algorithm works as follows:

Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
For each element, compare it with the previous elements in the sorted section of the array.
If the current element is smaller, shift the larger elements one position to the right to make space.
Place the current element in its correct sorted position.
Repeat these steps until the entire array is sorted.
